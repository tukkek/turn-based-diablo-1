# Turn-based Diablo 1

This is a fork of Devilution X that lets you play Diablo 1 as a turn-based game. The game will pause automatically when enemies are visible. Once you perform an action: it unpauses until that action is done and then pauses once-again: like a turn-based RPG, with all pausing being managed automatically.

No attempt has been made to re-balance the game to account for the ability to play much-more strategically. Players may challenge themselves or use self-imposed rules to their liking.

This has only been tested on single-player; using mouse-and-keyboard; on Linux. It will most-likely work on other computer operating-systems but don't expect it to work in multiplayer.
